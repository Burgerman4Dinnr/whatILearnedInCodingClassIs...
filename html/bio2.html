<h1>Thy Greatest Adventures of Kevin Barone. And yeah...</h1>
<h2>insert subtitle here</h2>
<p>My name is Kevin Barone. I was born in Jackson, Mississippi, raised in Hattiesburg, and moved to South America in 2017, and came back this year on March 14. Happiest day of my life :D. 
Here are some things I like, because this is what I'm told to do at the moment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <li>Computers</li>
    <li>Pretty much anything to do with tech</li>
    <li>and sleeping</li>
</ul>

<h2>More!</h2>

<p>so these are the things I do everyday....aka my tasks and whatnot:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I shower</li>
    <li>I go to work</li>
    <li>I work all day</li>
    <li>I go home</li>
    <li>I go to sleep</li>
    <li>I get up</li>
    <li>I shower</li>
    <li>I go to work</li>
    <li>I work all day</li>
    <li>I go home</li>
    <li>I go to sleep</li>
    <li>I get up</li>
    <li>I shower</li>
    <li>I go to work</li>
    <li>I work all day</li>
    <li>I go home</li>
    <li>I go to sleep</li>
    <li>and sooner or later I realize how repetative my life is....so yeah. Darn</li>

</ol>

<h2>More 2. The Sequel</h2>
<p>I speak 2 languages, because of my family. They are from Argentina, so I can speak English, and Spanish fluent-...well, a good bit of spanish. I can at least have a conversation. Big whoop. I moved back here on my own, and my family is still in Argentina. I am currently staying with my uncle, until I find a place of my own, so here I am now....trying to get myself somewhere in life, with something I enjoy the most. Computers, tech, yes.
But I am fully motivated, especially from this quote from a famous gamer:

<p>"𝓣𝓸 𝓫𝓮 𝓸𝓻 𝓷𝓸𝓽 𝓽𝓸 𝓫𝓮, 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓽 𝓲𝓼 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓺𝓾𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓲𝓸𝓷"

    - 𝓑𝓸𝓫 𝓜𝓪𝓻𝓵𝓮𝔂</p>

I also have 2 certificates. 1 for IT, and Graphics Designing. I REALLY love computer stuff. I can be a good editor. So hook me up ;)
</p>
<h2>More, but in links</h2>
<p>So I teamed up with a group of "film makers" to make a documentary of my life, that way I won't have to type it all out and I also get paid during the process. So check it out if you're willing to waste about 40 minutes of your time. Thank you, and enjoy ;)</p>
